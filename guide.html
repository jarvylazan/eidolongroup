        <p>This guide will help you get started with Eidolon Hunting. Keep in mind this is a beginners guide. A more advanced guide is needed for the most efficient hunts.</p>

            <h2>1. What are Eidolons?</h2>
          </header>
          <p>There are three big Eidolons in the Plains of Eidolon. Each are stronger than the one before:</p>
          <p></p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Eidolon Teralyst(nicknamed "Terry" by the Warframe Community)</li>
            <li>The Eidolon Gantulyst(nicknamed "Garry")</li>
            <li>The Eidolon Hydrolist(nicknamed "Harry")</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You may choose to capture or kill the Eidolons. But know that you
            <i>must</i>
            capture Terry before you can move on to hunting Garry. And you must then capture Garry to move on to Harry.
          </p>
          <code>Note: Killing Eidolons yield less rewards than capturing them. Capturing Eidolons is therefore harder, as you would need to master lure-handling.</code>

            <h2>2. What you will need</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Eidolon hunting is not for the faint of heart. You will need top-notch gear to partake in hunts efficiently. A mastery rank of 10 or higher is recommended. Damage buffing frames like
            <b>Volt, Rhino, Octavia</b>
            is recommended. Currently Volt is the king of Eidolon Hunting. Whether you are hunting as a full squad, or in trios, or duos, the meta would always be to have 2 Volts. Needless to say if you hunt solo the meta is often to bring Volt.
            Below is a list of equipment often used by hunters.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rubico Prime or Vectis Prime (Rubico is better if you go rivenless and Vectis is better if you have a slottable riven)</li>
            <li>
              A 1 7 7 amp(Raplak Prism, Propa Scaffold, Certus Brace. For more info refer to this wiki
              <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Amp">page</a>
              )
            </li>
            <li>

            <h2>3. The Mechanics</h2>
          </header>
          <p>It is important to know the mechanics by heart before setting out on the Plains. Due to the complexity of Eidolon hunting, it is very easy to get loss if you are not well informed about the steps, phases, spawn areas, etc.</p>
          <p>To get started, let us talk about the three Eidolons in detail.</p>
          <p>The Teralyst is the first and easiest of the three. It will spawn at random in any bodies of water. A solidly built frame will survive its attacks. Capturing Terry takes the least skill out of the 3.</p>

          <header>
            <h2>4. Eidolon lures and the Vomvalysts</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            In order to capture the Eidolons, you would need learn about the lures and Vomvalysts(nicknamed vomvs). Lures are found in grineer bases. Small installations have one lure each. Larger installations can have two(Hek's Stiletto for
            example).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each lure needs to be "charged" by either killing a vomv in its physical form near it or completely killing a vomvalyst in its physical
            <b>AND</b>
            void form and picking up the "goop/essence" that they drop and going close to the lure. Each lure would need 3 of these charges.
          </p>
          <p>In total, you would need this many lures for each eidolon:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 for terry. He has 4 limbs.</li>
            <li>3 for Garry. He has 6 limbs.</li>
            <li>3 for Harry. He has 6 limbs too.</li>
          </ul>
          <code>In total, for a complete hunt, you would need 8 charged lures.</code>
          <p>
            In
            <code>quads</code>
            and
            <code>trios</code>
            , there is typically a dedicated lure handler. In charge of all things lure related. Ideally, all lures should be fully prepared before the Hydrolist phase.

        <section id="5._Roles" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h2>5. Roles</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Now that you've read the basics, let's get onto the roles.</p>
          <h3>The DPS</h3>
          <ul>
            Commonly used frames:
            <li>Volt</li>
            <li>Mirage</li>
            <li>Ivara</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The DPS of the group is the hardest of the roles. To be a competent DPS, one must have the best gear in the game. Efficient hunts call for split-second limb breaking and capping. Volt is the most viable and easiest frame. Though pretty
            much any frame could be used.
          </p>
          <p>As a DPS, you need to take advantage of all damage boosting that you can get.</p>
          <h3>The VS(s)</h3>
          <ul>
            Commonly used frames:
            <li>Volt</li>
            <li>Harrow(superfluous in 6X/5Xs)</li>
            <li>Nova(often used in higher tier hunts)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The role of the VS is to break the shields of the Eidolons. Efficient hunts also require the VS to break the shields in less than a split-second.</p>
          <h3>Lure Handler</h3>
          <ul>
            Commonly used frames:
            <li>Wisp</li>
            <li>Trinity</li>
            <li>Ivara</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The lure handler's role is to, well, charge the lures. The DPS, who is supposed to be the host, comes out of the gate first. So they must be the one to take the first lure and charge it. Your role as handler is to take the other 7 lures
            and charge it. Making sure they are available before the Eidolon's cap.
          </p>
          <code>In duos, solos, and oftentime trios, the role of lure handling falls to the DPS.</code>
